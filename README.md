# The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Coding-Projects

This repository holds my final project for the Tech Academy C# and .Net Framework course. This is a car insurance web app created using Entity Framework database first. This allows a user to enter their data into a form and recieve a monthly car insurance quote based on their answers.
